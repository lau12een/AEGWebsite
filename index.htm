				<h1>About Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h1> 
				Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) is a form of wrestling in which the objective is to submit your opponent. Submission is either accomplished by choking, or hyper-extending your opponents joints. In BJJ tournaments, points are awarded to the fighter for advancing their position. In the event no submission is accomplished, the fighter with the most points at the end of the match wins. BJJ is often referred to as "human chess". Much like in a game of chess, a player must always be aware of their pieces, their opponents pieces, and the possible moves that any piece may make.  Similarly, a BJJ fighter must be aware of their body parts and position, their opponents body parts and position, and the moves that either may make.
